# html_slider_1
An html slider taking advantage of css overflow manipulation.

In short, the container overflows left and right with hidden elements. When user scrolls, a smooth scroll animation plays in the indicated direction. After animation plays, container snaps (smooth scroll off) back to default position in the middle, and html elements are shifted for an appearingly seamless transition.
